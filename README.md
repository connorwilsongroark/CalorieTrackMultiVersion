# Calorie Tracking Application Versioning

## Purpose

In this repository, I'm building multiple versions of a calorie tracking application with increasing levels of complexity and feature-richness as my needs change.

## Version 1

v1-basic-caltrack is a simple web application responsible for the following

- Persisting a collection of meals, their calorie counts, and protein content (g) in localstorage / indexedDB
- Allowing the entry of new meals, and totaling the calories and protein
- Grouping and displaying aggregated totals over time
